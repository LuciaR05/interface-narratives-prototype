PHOTOBOOTH SLIDESHOW PAGE
To emphasize the theme of the website, consider these ideas:
1. **Visual contrasts:** Use imagery that juxtaposes calm moments with chaos, illustrating COVID's unpredictable nature. 

2. **Text snippets:** Display quotes about varying perspectives on COVID, from personal experiences to government narratives, emphasizing how truth is fluid.

3. **Subtle animation:** Add moving text or elements that appear and disappear, symbolizing how COVID's impact is constantly evolving and changing.

4. **Timeline:** Create a visual timeline to show how the pandemic affected people differently, illustrating the non-absolute nature of its story.

"**The Truth About COVID: A Shifting Narrative**

The truth about COVID is not a fixed entity—it evolves based on personal experiences, government narratives, and ever-changing scientific data. For many, the pandemic brought isolation and uncertainty, with each individual's perspective offering a unique truth. Meanwhile, political leaders and health authorities presented differing accounts of the virus’s severity, measures, and timelines. This fluidity in what is considered "truth" reflects how the pandemic, though a shared experience, was understood and interpreted differently by governments, communities, and individuals alike."
